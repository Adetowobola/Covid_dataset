# Covid_dataset
Covid Dataset of 5 countries 
Data collected was on infection rates,mortality and vaccination.

The Analysis was done to gain insights on spread of disease , identify relationships between new cases,new deaths and vaccination over a period of time.

Python was the tool used for the analysis.

Three major steps was used to Analyze the data

2) I explored the data to gain insights into trends , compared new deaths and new cases , checked the distribution across countries, Correlation between cases , effects of vaccinations .
